# Project Title

passiFer

## Description

Passifer was conceived out of a desire to address a common pain point â€“ the challenge of remembering passwords. Inspired by observing my partner struggle with password management, I embarked on the journey to create a solution from scratch. Given my affinity for Node.js and MongoDB, I opted to develop Passifer using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Embracing the versatility of this stack, I leveraged a combination of Express.js and MongoDB client for backend calls, capitalizing on the strengths of each for optimal functionality. Additionally, I eschewed external CSS frameworks, opting instead to craft the CSS from scratch using Tailwind CSS. This decision not only allowed me to personalize the app's aesthetics but also provided an opportunity to expand my skill set by delving into Tailwind CSS.
