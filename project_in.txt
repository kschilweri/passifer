problem faced:

when i was deleting an entry, backend was only deleting the first entry added. I tried to 
send the mongoDB(_id) to the backend in the body. the backend then req.body._id and successfully received it,
but it was not deleting the entry. Kept showing success message. I am using mongodb package for this app for experience as ive used express models in prev app.
after trial and error, i found that no matter what i did, the backend received the _id as a string and not as ObjectId type (default mongoDb type for id)
i tried to delete an entry by passing a query with the site, username, password in body and it worked!

So i had to manually fill an id for each entry i passed. after researching, i stumbled upon npm uuid. now the id generated was unique and was a string.
i passed this uuid in the query to the backend and voila! entry is deleted!
